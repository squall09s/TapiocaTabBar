# ðŸ§‹ TapiocaTabBar

**TapiocaTabBar** is a playful and smooth custom tab bar built with SwiftUI.  
Inspired by the soft, gliding texture of tapioca pearls, this component brings a fresh, fluid experience to app navigation.

Designed to blend aesthetics with motion, TapiocaTabBar aligns icons and titles horizontally in a unique, animated layout â€” perfect for apps that want to stand out with personality and polish.

Because tab bars can be fun, too.
